<h1>Parking Oracle</h1>
<h3>Senior Project (2021)</h3>
<hr>

As university students weâ€™ve often experienced the hassle of coming to campus for a lab or for an event and being unable to find parking because all the lots we normally use are filled up. Then it becomes a game of driving around, often on a crowded campus, to find viable parking. <br>
We want our application, parking oracle, to be a general use parking application that uses computer vision to provide accurate information about the state of parking on campus. Our goal is to have our computer vision system be able to tell how full a parking lot on campus is, preventing the needless shuffle of people driving around campus on move in day or during football games. By opening the app, those who need to find a place to park on campus (either with or without a pass) will get a list of parking lots and how full they are; finding parking will never be easier.
